review: Congratulations on the launch! I have been excited to have had the opportunity to use Saner, and am looking forward to continuing to use it in the future for my use cases. The user interface is very intuitive, and I've appreciated being able to give my feedback and see the responsiveness of the developers to my suggestions for improvement. I've used MANY different personal knowledge management tools, but this tool's marriage of AI and my personal documents opens up a whole new realm of opportunities to synthesize and leverage what I am interested in to find and create new insights based on that information!
