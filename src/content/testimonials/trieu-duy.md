order: 4
job: "Building a super app for musicgame"
review: "I used to use Notion, Google Docs, and Obsidian. But now it is Saner.AI The app helps me to do all of the things I hate to do when writing/storing information The past: Read interesting things or self-reflection -> draft (writing) -> leave it there forever (like trash) Now: Read interesting things or self-reflection -> draft -> Saner structures them or make them reusable (not trash anymore) -> easily recall all knowledge I write Highly recommend"
