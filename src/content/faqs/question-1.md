If you are struggling with context switching, overwhelming features & forgetfulness, then Saner.ai is a tool for you.

If you captured thousands of notes wholeheartedly but couldn't retrieve them when you wanted and failed to make use of them, then Saner.ai is a tool for you.

Saner.ai is an All-in-one AI Productivity app for ADHD with **a simple-design note and to-do list with best-in-class AI Assistants** to help you easily note, recall, create insights, and get things done.

-   The personal AI assistant knows your notes and enables you to search, and ask based on what you remember and suggests relevant knowledge you have saved.
-   On UX, we enable quick capture via side panel note, the ability to use many AI in one app & a chat bar alongside your note.
