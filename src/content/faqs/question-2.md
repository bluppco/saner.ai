We focus on building a more **seamless workflow** to reduce context switching with an emphasis on AIs. We have differentiated features like

1. It makes note-taking easy. You wonâ€™t get too many things on the screen to burden or distract you.
2. You can research, write, organize, find, and use your notes with minimal switching between apps or views not to disrupt your focus.
3. It offers Skai, your smart personal assistant that knows all your notes. It can solve ADHD's memory problem, which makes you struggle to remember information, by helping you with any questions about any information you noted.
4. Saner.AI will offer task assistance via the chat interface. It includes planning, status checks, scheduling, and optimized reminders for ADHD.

That's why we believe Saner.ai is the well-crafted AI Productivity app for ADHD.
